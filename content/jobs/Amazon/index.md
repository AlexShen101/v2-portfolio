- Built auto-scaling solution for queue-based worker service using AWS CDK and TypeScript to dynamically scale worker instances based on thread utilization, reducing worker costs by 40%.
- Created multithreaded Python load testing scripts to simulate high API traffic and validate performance of auto-scaling strategies.
- Developed test workers using Java to test auto-scaling in deployment pipeline for regression testing.
- Researched and implemented optimal scaling strategy by analyzing CloudWatch metrics (thread utilization, queue size, message age) to identify optimal configuration
