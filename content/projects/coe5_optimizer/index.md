A reinforcement learning system that masters tactical combat through self-play. Built a grid-based battle engine simulating Conquest of Elysium 5 combat mechanics, then trained a Maskable PPO agent to discover optimal army compositions. Through curriculum learning and thousands of simulated battles, agents learn winning strategies against diverse opponents across varying budgets.
